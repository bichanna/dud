# dud

dud is basically C for people who are lazy but want a fraction of the power of C. It's a programming language infused with lots of personal preferences for syntax, safety, and metaprogramming.

## Goals

- Basically C with a bit nicer syntax
- Compiles to standard C code, ensuring compatibility
- Automatic memory management through reference counting that handle circular references
- Built-in implementations of dynamic arrays, hash maps, and other useful things
- Use functions, types, and other stuff from C without too much fuss
- Generics and protocols (static dispatch)!
- Not too many features being introduced
